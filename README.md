Citi Bike Ride Data

This Project examined The ridership of Citi Bike riders in February of 2014 using Tableau. 

Ridership Hours seemed to have 2 peaks. There is an 8 am peak most likely due to to the morning work commute and a higher peak at 5 pm for the rush hour commute. Surprisingly the number of bike rides at 5 pm are twice as high as the number of morning rides. This may be due to customer taking other routes of transportation such as the bus on their way to work, but then choose to take the bike home. Or it may be due to another reason that ridership is higher in the afternoon, such as leisure peak time.
